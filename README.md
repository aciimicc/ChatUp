**ChatUp** is a simple chat application that can send and recieve messages in real-time, from iOS, Android or Web. This project was developed for a Software Engineering course, and it shows group work, and it shows the ability of the persons that are assigned to develop software withing specific time frame.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

**Frontend**:
- **Flutter**: Flutter is used for converting the design of the application into the app, we are using flutter because one code is for Android, iOS and Web.

**Backend**:
- Tehcnologies: **Node.js with Express.js**
- Database: **MongoDB with Mongoose**
- Communication protocol: **WebSockets(Socket.io for Node.js)**
**Deployment & hosting**
  - Frontend hosting: **Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages or Firebase Hosting**
  - Backend hosting: **Vercel**
  - **Note**: This is a subject for change because it is too early in development to choose front and backend hosting. Since this is a college project, we are not funded and we will evaluate which one of these servers have the best free tier.
